%DECODE_CALCPOST Given spikes & ratemap get posterior probability
% Decodes spatial location based on historic and current spikes. For each
% time step activity in population of cells is compared with ratemaps and a
% posterior probability of the animal being in different locations is
% calculated assuming possion dynamics.
%
% Replaces functions that were specialised for 1D or 2D, this works for
% both. Also take either a single time bin or multiple time bins and hence
% outputs either a single posterior or a sequence of them. Also works for
% non-integer spike counts (approximates factorial with gamma function)
%
% Note fourth argument (which is optional) allows the normalisation to be
% turned off so the posterior doesn't sum to 1. Be careful with this since
% ratemap bins with 0hz spikes will each yield a probability of 1 if no
% spikes are observed.
%
% Calculation of the posterior  is based on that which
% we used in Towse (2014) which is based on Mathis (2012) eq 3.1 page9.
