%DECODE_PROCESSPOST Use ML  to decode posterior prob & measure accuracy
% Having calculated the posterior probability matrix now use it to actually
% decode location - take max liklihood estimate (i.e. most probable bin -
% if several are joint just pick on at random). Based on decoded location
% all so calculate several measures of performance: decodeError - Euclidian
% distance between true and decoded location; probAtTrueLoc - the value of
% the probability matrix at the animals actual location.
%
% NB. To ignore speicific time steps set all values in the post for that
% timestep to nan.

% ARGS
% post          The posterior probability matrix returned by
%               decode_calcPost.m [envSz1 x envSz2 x nTimeBin]. TimeBins
%               with all nan valus are ignored
%
% posData       The pos branch of the standard tint strucutre e.g.
%               data.pos (which has true position in xy pairs of pixels)
%
% sBin          Spatial binsize in pixels (NOTE not in cm)
%
% pos2use       [nPos x 1] Index into data.pos.xy indicating which pos
%               points were used for decoding. If not specified defaults to
%               allOfPos i.e. (1:length(data.pos.xy)). Note only complete
%               time windows are considered - if length(pos2use) is not
%               exactly divisible by tBin then trailing pos are ignored.
%               NB2. pos2use must be a continuous sequence.
%
% winLim        Pos_samples defining the start and end of each window.
%               These bins are inclusive hence if start and end pos are w
%               and v then spikes falling in pos samp w and v are counted
%               in that bin. [nBin x 2] [start, end]. Note this matrix is
%               retruned by decode_getSpkCnt

% RETURNS
% err           Vector of decoding errors at each timestep (error being
%               distance betweewn true and decoded location in PIXELS).
%               Unprocessed bins are nan
%
% decXY         Decoded location in xy pair (pixels) at each time bin -
%               unprocessed steps are nan. Locatin is decoded to a bin at
%               each time step, the centre of that bin is returned as the
%               decoded location.
%
% trueXY        Actualy xy location of the bin centre that the rat inhabits
%               during each time step (i.e. find mean location in each time
%               window, allocate that to a bin, use centre of that bin)
%
% mlVal         Value of peak bin in post at each time step
